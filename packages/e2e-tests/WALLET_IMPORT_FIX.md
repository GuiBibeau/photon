# Wallet Import Fix Documentation

## Problem

When importing a wallet from a private key via environment variable, the wallet would display correctly but signing operations would fail with:

```
Key generation failed: A parameter or an operation is not supported by the underlying object
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in how the imported wallet was being used for signing:

1. The `importSolanaKeySigner` function returns a `CryptoKeySigner` object
2. We were trying to extract its internal `keyPair` property and wrap it in a `KeyPair` class
3. When later code tried to use `importCryptoKeySignerFromKeyPair` on this wrapped KeyPair, it failed because the structure wasn't compatible

## Solution

The fix involves:

1. **Returning both KeyPair and Signer**: The `importWalletFromPrivateKey` function now returns both the `KeyPair` wrapper (for compatibility) and the original `CryptoKeySigner` object
2. **Storing the signer in wallet state**: Added a `signer` field to the `WalletState` interface to store the CryptoKeySigner
3. **Using the signer when available**: Updated all signing operations to check for and use the `signer` field first, falling back to creating a signer from `keyPair` only when necessary

## Code Changes

### wallet-import.ts

- Now returns `{ keyPair, signer, address }` instead of just `{ keyPair, address }`
- Properly extracts the CryptoKeyPair from the signer and wraps it in KeyPair for compatibility

### AppContext.tsx

- Added `signer?: any` field to `WalletState` interface
- Stores the signer when loading wallet from environment variable

### UnifiedDashboard.tsx

- Updated all signing operations to check for `wallet.signer` first
- Falls back to creating a signer from `wallet.keyPair` if no signer is available
- This ensures imported wallets use their original signer with proper signing capabilities

## Testing

1. Set `VITE_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` file with a valid 64-byte Solana private key
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. The wallet should load automatically
4. All operations should work: signing messages, creating tokens, transferring tokens

## Supported Private Key Formats

The import function now supports multiple formats:

- Base58 (standard Solana format)
- Hex with 0x prefix
- Hex without prefix
- JSON array of bytes
- Comma-separated bytes

This makes it flexible for developers using different tools and key formats.
